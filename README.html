<p>OrderUp HookUp is the answer to the question "What's for dinner?"</p>

<p>Can't decide what you're in the mood for? Just put in your location and see what shows up!</p>

<h2>Tech</h2>

<p>OrderUp HookUp uses Yelp's Fusion API v3 and Google Places and Maps APIs for data. </p>

<p>The backend is running Node.js with Express. The front end is running Angular 1.5.8 and Extended JavaScript to handle and dynamically display different data. </p>

<p>Twitter Bootstrap and regular HTML, CSS, and Javascript are all used for design. All logo design was done on Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop.</p>
