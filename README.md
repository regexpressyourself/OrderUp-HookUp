OrderUp HookUp is the answer to the question "What's for dinner?"

Can't decide what you're in the mood for? Just put in your location and see what shows up!

## Tech

OrderUp HookUp uses Yelp's Fusion API v3 and Google Places and Maps APIs for data. 

The backend is running Node.js with Express. The front end is running Angular 1.5.8 and Extended JavaScript to handle and dynamically display different data. 

Twitter Bootstrap and regular HTML, CSS, and Javascript are all used for design. All logo design was done on Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop.
